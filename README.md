## üöÄ Installation

### üì¶ Install from crates.io (recommended)

If you have Rust installed, you can install `ttr` directly with Cargo:

```bash
cargo install ttr
```
This will download, build, and place the binary in ~/.cargo/bin.
Make sure that directory is in your PATH.
`ttr` is easy to install if you have the Rust toolchain installed.
